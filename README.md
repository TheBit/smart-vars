# Smart Vars
JS Script for automating fancy effects creation using CSS variables

The good description is still TBD...

This is inspired by playing around with:
1. https://github.com/VALiUMgithub/ProximityHoverEffect which is codification of https://youtu.be/TGe3pS5LqEw which is in turn inspired by https://pocketbase.io/.
2. https://codepen.io/Hyperplexed/pen/MWQeYLW which is a tutorial from https://youtu.be/htGfnF1zN4g which is in turn inspired by https://linear.app/features.

Thanx for your work!

With Smart Vars you can archive the same effects without writing JS code yourself (but instead using this script).

The motivation for such a need comes from B2B projects with Headless CMS at a core. 
This is when you provide some pre-made (but customizable) UI components to your (B2B) customers, and allow them to use
arbitrary HTML, CSS, and JS.
But you wish to ease/speed up their work on some popular effects (like those mentioned above) by eliminating the need to 
code custom JS logic for each such effect.

## TODO
- [ ] Add Global Mouse Tracker
- [ ] Add Line Segment distance calculation
- [ ] Add mouse scroll handling
- [ ] Watch the rest of Hyperplexed (and others) and find good candidates for Smart Vars
